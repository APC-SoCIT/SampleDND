"The Path Ahead"

You need to do what must be done,
Before the race, before the fun.
The road is steep, the steps are slow,
But onward still, you learn, you grow.

With heavy hands, you build the way,
Through sleepless nights and weary days.
The dreams you chase seem far and wide,
Yet steady strides will close the divide.

For when the work is finally through,
You'll find the joy belongs to you.
The freedom comes, the moment's near,
The things you want will soon be clear.

But first, the taskâ€”don't shy away,
The climb will lead to brighter days.
So hold your ground, and push on through,
Do what you must, and dreams pursue.
